      "description": "ðŸ‘‹ I am a transitioning Navy Veteran who recently completed my bachelorâ€™s degree in Information Technology Management.  In my time in the military I have spent time working as a technician, a supervisor, a manager, and a mentor.  I used those values to support Navy fleet readiness.  I plan on using those same skills I have learned over the last 9 years in the Navy as well as life skills to bring a new perspective to the software development world.   I am a dedicated team member who looks forward to challenging myself with this next mission in life.",
